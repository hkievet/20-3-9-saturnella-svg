What I would like to achieve this morning:

- Eventually I want to experiment with making a custom webpack loader for a new filetype or a way for me to add frontmatter to a markdown file and make my own form of a Gatsby cms

load all files in a directory as array in typescript

This solution comes close, but it still requires the use of an index.ts file.

I could make a script that automatically creates the indesx file.

# Front Matter files

This is what I use for grav development [Front Matter Files][].

This loader looks exactly what I want except I would like to be able to import _every_ markdown file in a certain directory: [frontmatter loader][].
